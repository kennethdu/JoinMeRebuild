# _Site Rebuild_

#### _Friday Independent Project for Epicdous, 10.26.2018/ 11.2.2018_

#### By _**Kenneth Du**_

## Description

_Site Rebuild._

You're almost 75% of the way through Epicodus (not including your internship) and it's time to start building more portfolio pieces!

Over the next two weeks, you'll rebuild a site of your choice using Angular, as described in the Code Review Prep: Rebuilding a Site with Angular lesson from earlier this week. Refer back to this lesson for more details, and an explanation of how your project will be evaluated.

Today, you should focus on planning your application and building and separating your application into components. If you have additional time, consider adding a pipe and jumping into next week's content (such as adding a database or a router).
Building Out Your Application

Once you have built out the basic structure of your application and separated the code into working components, consider adding:

    More directives (practice with ngIf, ngFor, and more).
    Full CRUD functionality that changes your models.
    Firebase (a noSQL database) instead of a hard-coded dataset.
    Seed data for your database.
    Pipes for filtering data.
    A router for adding additional pages.
    Authentication and route guards.
    Deployment (as a dry run for next week).
    API calls.
    CSS styling.
    Tests using Jasmine and Protractor.
